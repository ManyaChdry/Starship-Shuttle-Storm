# First-Pygame

This is my first attempt at game development. <br>
Uses PYTHON (PYGAME MODULE) <br>
Tried to create an engaging twoâ€‘player space shooter with dynamic gameplay and graphics <br>
I named it Rebel Galaxy since it has two space shuttles that shoot at each other, the shuttle that gets hit loses one point. <br>
The spaceship that reaches zero points first loses the game!
